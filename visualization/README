A frequent problem that plagues magnetic research is that card reads are not
consistent across swipes. Furthermore, it is difficult to create independent
implementations without known good read data. Additionally, magnetic stripe
data is not uniformly represented as perfectly perpendicular information
across a horizontal plane.

Using a suitably large magnetic viewer it should be possible to capture a
high resolution image of the magnetic field of the specimen. The image should
then be processed into a monochromatic representation of the fields. The
resulting image should have a point of reference for scale. The magnetic fields
should now be clearly visible and parsable as a matrix.

The matrix can be easily divided into bits. The height of each track is
parsable by gaps in the matrix. The width and angle of each bit is possible to
detect by sampling "random" reads across the height of each track.

With this method of visualizing and processing magnetic stripe data, it should
be possible eliminate read errors with a single visual sample. Additionally, it
becomes possible to parse arbitrary angled data with a single sample.

The output of this technique should be a bit stream that can be written back to
a magnetic substance for reconfirmation with a separate reader.
