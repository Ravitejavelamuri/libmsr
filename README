libmsr - libmsr is basically magnetic stripe reading

This is a library for various magnetic stripe reading and writing hardware.

Generally, it requires a serial interface. In the future we may support
other methods of access.

You'll probably want to take a look at the utils/ directory for sample code
that uses libmsr properly.

If you wish to use a generic audio device as your reader, you'll want to
install the libsndfile1-dev library. We're in the process of integrating
dmsb/dab.

It is highly suggested to read all of the README files in the package.
A good start would be the README.magnetic-introduction file.
