libmsr - libmsr is basically magnetic stripe reading

This is a library for various magnetic stripe reading and writing hardware.

Generally, it requires a serial interface. In the future we may support
other methods of access.

You'll probably want to take a look at the utils/ directory for sample code
that uses libmsr properly.
