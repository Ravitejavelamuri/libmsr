libmsr - libmsr is basically magnetic stripe reading

This project is an independent Free Software implementation of the protocol for
the MSR 206 magnetic stripe reader/writer. It is intended to be both a library
for use in other programs that wish to interface with the MSR 206 and as a
collection of useful user space programs.

The MSR 206 comes in various flavors and can do three track reading and writing
of magnetic data. It can write both HiCo? and LoCo? cards in ISO standard
formats or in a raw data mode for specifically tailored data.

This program will allow you to backup your current magnetic stripe data. In
addition as a developer or user, you can interface with raw magnetic stripe
data without having to use proprietary software.

Eventually, this library will support other readers or writers and not just the
MSR-206. It currently has partial support for the MAKInterface MAKStripe
reader/writer.

What is libmsr?
---------------
This is a library for various magnetic stripe reading and writing hardware.

What kind of hardware can I use?
--------------------------------
Generally, libmsr requires a device with a serial interface. In the future we
may support other methods of access. Currently supported hardware is outlined
on our wiki:

Where are sample programs that I can study, improve, and share?
---------------------------------------------------------------
You'll probably want to take a look at the utils/ directory for sample code
that uses libmsr properly.

What kind of experimental hardware is in the future of libmsr?
--------------------------------------------------------------
Lots! The MakStripe is a work in progress:

Additionally, audio readers such as the circuits found in 2600 or in the Square
device are paritally supported.

If you wish to use a generic audio device as your reader, you'll want to
install the libsndfile1-dev library. We're in the process of integrating
dmsb/dab.

Where should I start?
---------------------
It is highly suggested to read all of the README files in the package.
A good start would be the README.magnetic-introduction file.
