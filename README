libmsr - libmsr is basically magnetic stripe reading

What is libmsr?
---------------
This is a library for various magnetic stripe reading and writing hardware.

What kind of hardware can I use?
--------------------------------
Generally, libmsr requires a device with a serial interface. In the future we
may support other methods of access. Currently supported hardware is outlined
on our wiki:

Where are sample programs that I can study, improve, and share?
---------------------------------------------------------------
You'll probably want to take a look at the utils/ directory for sample code
that uses libmsr properly.

What kind of experimental hardware is in the future of libmsr?
--------------------------------------------------------------
Lots! The MakStripe is a work in progress:

Additionally, audio readers such as the circuits found in 2600 or in the Square
device are paritally supported.

If you wish to use a generic audio device as your reader, you'll want to
install the libsndfile1-dev library. We're in the process of integrating
dmsb/dab.

Where should I start?
---------------------
It is highly suggested to read all of the README files in the package.
A good start would be the README.magnetic-introduction file.
