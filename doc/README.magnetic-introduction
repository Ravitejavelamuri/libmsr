This is a collection of related and useful notes that you should read if you're
interested in magstripes. It is useful to see the phyisical layer of magnetic
information before you attempt to analyze it with actual hardware. Using a
viewer or developer is a very useful first step. This will help you see very
obvious issues with data alignment. Traditional ISO encoded data is written
perpendicular to the length of the magnetic stripe. Proprietary cards may
use alternate physical angles even if they use ISO format error coding.

Magnetic cards are encoded with a specific magnetic field strength.
This field strength is measured in Oersted (commonly abbreviated as Oe):

To measure the coercive force (Hc) of a magnetic field, you may want to acquire
a rather expensive B-H Analyzer:

If you're interested in calibration of your reading or writing devices, you may
want to acquire a set of QCards:

If you'd like to do visual inspection of small amounts of magnetic material,
you may want to invest in a basic Arnold Magnetics viewer:

If you're really feeling like splurging, perhaps the MV-95 is the viewer for
your magnetic field needs?

If you have special needs relating to audio tapes and magnetics, you may be
interested in a liquid magnetic developer such as the Sprague-Mag HCFC 141B:

If you find the Sprague Magnetics people a little slow to respond, you may
be interested in a similar developer from Q-Card:

If you want to design your own reading and writing devices, it's probably
reasonable to look into acquiring special hardware from Brush:

You'll want to have a reader for experimentation. It's a good idea to get a
high quaility MSR-206 3 track hi-co/lo-co reader/writer:

It's very useful to read the various related magnetic stripe ISO standards:

	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7810
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7811
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7812
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7813
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583

Another helpful starter is the Wikipedia's magnetic stripe page:
