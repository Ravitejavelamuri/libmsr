Abstract out all commands into model specific headers.
	If the model is generic, we'll reference the generic with macros

Add support for the following hardware:

	Mini-123
	Mini-123EX
	Mini-400
	Mini-600
	NMR-100
	Omron S4YR-MVFW

Implement some kind of data analysis. Perhaps with Stripe Snoop?

Implement emulators for the hardware we do support.

	We should be able to operator libmsr on a named pipe!
